# Interpreter
Interpreter for a toy language, implemented in Java, during the Advanced Programming
Methods course. 
The language supports expressions (arithmetic, boolean, constant, variable), 
statements (if, while, print, assignment), working with files (open, read and close files),
access to heap memory, multithreading (fork statement) and procedure manipulation
(declare and call procedures).
The application comes with a GUI, implemented using JavaFX, which allows the user
to choose one of the predefined programs and run it step by step (the state of 
program is displayed at each step).
